#Relias Learning Assessment: Movie Search
I used a build tool from The Iron Yard to work on this assignment. Some of the information about it is below.

For this project, I used React components and Backbone collections (Movies) and models (Movie). My code can be found in the app folder. I worked with the OMBd API and also included promises for the AJAX request to this API. The AJAX request is done in the Movies Collection.

I did very basic testing on these as well, using Chai-Enzyme. The testing can be found in the test folder.

My 4 styles files can be found in the scss folder, which is within the app folder. I styled the home page and the results section separately.
